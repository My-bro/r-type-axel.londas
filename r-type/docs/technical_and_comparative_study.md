## üïπÔ∏è **4. ECS Architecture (Entity Component System)**

### **Why ECS?**

- **Decoupling**: ECS promotes a clear separation of concerns by decoupling entities, components, and systems.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable; new components and systems can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Performance**: Efficient use of cache-friendly data structures (e.g., contiguous arrays like `std::vector`).
- **Flexibility**: Systems operate independently, making it easy to parallelize tasks and optimize performance.

### **Comparison with Other Architectures**

| **Architecture**     | **Pros**                                         | **Cons**                                 |

| **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** | Good for UI-based applications          | Not suitable for real-time systems       |

### **Key ECS Functions**

- **`register_component`**: Registers new components.
- **`add_component`**: Adds a component to an entity.
- **`spawn_entity`**: Creates a new entity.
- **`kill_entity`**: Removes an entity and its components.

## üíæ **Storage**

### **Why In-Memory Storage?**

- **Real-Time Performance**: In-memory storage (using `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`) ensures fast access times.
- **No Persistence Requirement**: Since this is a game, there is no need for long-term persistence.

### **Considerations**

- **Future Extensions**: For saving game states, a simple serialization mechanism (e.g., JSON, binary files) can be added.
